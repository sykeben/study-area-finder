# study-area-finder (AKA: Where2Study)
*Find a random study area on your campus (If I've added it)*

## Supported Campuses
- Purdue University
- *More coming soon!*

## TO-DOs
- [ ] Add address links to dataset to allow for directions to each building.
- [ ] Revise randomization logic to pick buildings out of a bag and then reset the bag after it runs out (this should stop repeats).
